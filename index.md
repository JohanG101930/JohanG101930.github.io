I am a computer science student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2028.

##Favorite Labs from CPSC 120L

*Lab 4, Part 1

  I enjoyed doing this lab because we were calculating and converting the volume of milliliters to teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups using the code double. Once my partners and I got the hang of it, it was easy to finish units.cc by writing the rest of the code.

*Lab 9, Part 1

  This is my second favorite lab because we started working with fstream files to count how many words were there and how many misspelled words. This was tricky because it was hard to write the codes down and it took me and my partner a little while to get it down.
