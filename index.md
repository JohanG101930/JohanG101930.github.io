I am a computer science student at California State Univeristy Fullerton and I expect to graduate in 2029.

##Favorite Labs from CPSC 120L

* Lab 4, Part 1

  I enjoyed doing this lab because we were calculating and converting the volume of milliliters to teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups using the code double. Once my partners and I got the hang of it, it was easy to finish units.cc by writing the rest of the code. Bieng able to talk with my partner and work on the lab together was enjoying since they were welcoming and productive.

* Lab 9, Part 1

  This is my second favorite lab because we started working with fstream files to count how many words were there and how many misspelled words. This was tricky because it was hard to write the codes down and it took me and my partner a little while to get it down. Once we figured out thst we had to code it with bool, for and if, and const std::string, my parter and I were able to do it. In the end it was fun doing the lab part 1 because it was a little complex and I enjoy working on challenging codes. 

* Lab 11

  I enjoyed the whole lab 11 because my partner and I started working on classes and how to set it up. The easy parts were setting up the classes like name_, population_ and land_area_. The programmers use these private classes so people running the code do not have to use it. Overall this lab was pretty fun and easy once you get the hang of it.
